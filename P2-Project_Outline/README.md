# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This will be a flashcard application. I used to work in a school and work with kids that were practicing math and vocabulary facts. I've seen them do the old school flash cards and I've seen online versions. But, I wish teachers could make their own decks for their students to practice, based on what they're teaching. Students would have their own accounts and access to the decks that they need to practice. I'd like to add a feature where they can see their progress by looking at a list of the cards in the deck and seeing the percentage of accuracy on each individual card. And, on a more advanced level, there can be vocabulary decks where the word is scrambled and the student has to type in the correct word. Finally, I'd like to create a teacher account that has access to all decks, can create new decks, and can see the accuracy reports for each student to see their progress.
### Features
#Login: students have their own accounts and the teacher can see all student accounts
#Decks: Choose a deck (object?) to quiz on (matching key/value pairs); answers will be user input
#Data: Collect accuracy of each key/value pair and show report (SQL based)
### Technologies
#JavaScript
#JQuery
#MySQL
#Angular or React (still deciding)
### What I'll Have to Learn
#How to create the decks in the most efficient way (I've been flipping between objects or arrays: arrays are *easier* but extremely messy, objects are cleaner but I'm unsure of how to divide them in separate cards)
#How to use Angular or React. I don't know the difference between the two, so I'll go over them and decide which will work best for me.
#How to connect MySQL to JavaScript. Since I've only done that with Java and IntelliJ, I haven't done it with VSCode. I think ww3 has a tutorial on that. 
#I ordered a book about JavaScript and object-orientation that talks about JQuery. I have no clue what that is, but sure. I'll learn it.
